Linear regression Analysis

Intent of the Analysis:

A bike-sharing system is a service in which bikes are made available for shared use to individuals on a short term basis for a price or free. Many bike share systems allow people to borrow a bike from a "dock" which is usually computer-controlled wherein the user enters the payment information, and the system unlocks it. This bike can then be returned to another dock belonging to the same system.

Our intent is to model the demand for sahred bikes with the predictor varaibles. The model will be used by the company to understand how the demand is varying with resprect to the different features, the management can leverage it to improve the productivity.


The steps followed:

Step 1: Understanding the Data
Step 2: Cleaning the data and EDA
Step 3: Building the model.
Step 4: Residual analysis.
Step 5: Predicting and evaluating the model.

Technologies used: Python incorporated with Pandas, Numpy, seaborn modules. Git.
